## Getting Started: How to Run These Projects

To run any of the projects in this repository on your local machine, please follow these general steps. Each individual project section below lists the necessary libraries specific to that project.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

*   **Git:** For cloning the repository.
    *   [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
*   **Python 3.8+:** The projects are developed with Python 3.8 or newer.
    *   [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
*   **Command Line Interface (CLI):** Access to your system's terminal (e.g., Command Prompt on Windows, Terminal on macOS/Linux).

### Step-by-Step Instructions

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    Open your terminal or command prompt and clone this entire portfolio to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/5749-ayush/Data-Science-and-Machine-learning-portfolio.git
    ```
    Navigate into the cloned directory:
    ```bash
    cd Data-Science-and-Machine-learning-portfolio
    ```

2.  **Navigate to a Specific Project:**
    Each project is contained within its own subfolder. Choose the project you wish to run and navigate into its directory.
    For example, to run the `FakeNewsDetection` project:
    ```bash
    cd FakeNewsDetection/
    ```
    *(Replace `FakeNewsDetection/` with the actual folder name of the project you want to run.)*

3.  **Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended):**
    It's highly recommended to create a Python virtual environment to manage project dependencies independently and avoid conflicts with other Python installations on your system.
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

4.  **Activate the Virtual Environment:**
    Activate the newly created virtual environment. All subsequent `pip install` commands will install libraries into this isolated environment.

    *   **On Windows (Command Prompt):**
        ```bash
        venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    *   **On macOS/Linux (or Git Bash on Windows):**
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```
    You should see `(venv)` preceding your command prompt, indicating the environment is active.

5.  **Install Project Dependencies:**
    After activating the virtual environment, you will need to install the required Python libraries for the specific project you are working on. Refer to the "Key Dependencies" section under each project's detailed overview below for the list of libraries that
    have been mention in each project description when you scroll down.

    For example, if you are in the `FakeNewsDetection/` folder, you would run:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn tensorflow nltk
    ```
    *(**Important:** You might need to install specific versions if errors occur, e.g., `pip install tensorflow==2.10.0`. If a library fails to install, try searching for its common installation method or a compatible version online.)*

7.  **Run the Project:**
    Once the dependencies are installed and the virtual environment is active, you can run the project code:

    *   **For Python scripts (e.g., `.py` files):**
        ```bash
        python your_project_script_name.py
        ```
        *(e.g., `python Fake_News_dector.py` for this project)*

    *   **For Jupyter Notebooks (e.g., `.ipynb` files, often used in ML projects):**
        First, ensure `jupyter` is installed (you might need to `pip install jupyter` if it's not covered by other listed dependencies). Then run:
        ```bash
        jupyter notebook
        ```
        This will open Jupyter in your web browser. Navigate to the `.ipynb` file for the current project and execute its cells.

    *   **For Google Colab Notebooks:**
        You can directly open the `.ipynb` files in Google Colab from the GitHub interface. Click on the `.ipynb` file in the GitHub repository, and then look for the "Open in Colab" button or simply upload the notebook to your Google Colab environment.
